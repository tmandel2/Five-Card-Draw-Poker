USER STORIES FOR VIDEO POKER

The game starts with the user being able to provide their name.

A press of the start button will show a poker table with no cards dealt.

The user will have a wallet with a certain amount of money, and be able to bet what they want before being dealt.

Upon clicking a "deal" button, five cards will be shown in front of the user.

They can click on any or all of the five cards to "hold".

Upon clicking the "deal" button again, the non-held cards will be replaced with new cards.

The application will then alert the player if they had any hands that will pay out.

The user wallet will be updated.

The user will then click a "play again" button which will allow them to make a new bet using their updated wallet amount.

If at the end of a hand, the user has no money in their wallet, the game will display "game over!" and offer a restart button.
